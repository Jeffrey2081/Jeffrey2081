# 👋 Hey, I'm Jeffrey2081  

🚀 Arch Linux Enthusiast | 🛠 Open Source Dev | ⚡ AI & Custom Linux Builds  

I run **Arch BTW**, and I love creating Arch-based projects, custom setups, and experimenting with **minimal, powerful, and futuristic** Linux configurations. My repositories focus on **Arch Linux**, **BSPWM**, AI integrations, and other cool projects.  

## 🔥 What I Do  
- 🏗️ **Custom Arch Linux Builds** – Tweaking and refining **BSPWM** and more.  
- 📀 **Arch-Based Installer ISO** – Automating installation with **my own configurations**.  
- 🤖 **AI & Automation** – Running **OLAMA AI** models and training **Solar AI RAG** models.
